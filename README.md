# School District Analysis

## Purpose
We want to analyze the difference in grades for Thomas High School when including or excluding 9th grade students.
## Results
### District Summary Comparison
When we look at the difference between including and excluding the THS 9th grade students in regards to the overall district results we see that the overall passing rate reduces by .3%. This may not seem significant but being that comparatively there were few THS 9th grade students showing that their grades likely dropped significantly 
### School Summary
In the school summary it is very obvious that there is a major difference in overall passing statistics. Before removing the 9th grade statistics we see about a 90.9% overall passing rate, but after we see a drop to 90.6%. This is a not a huge red flag there there is something fishy going on.

### High and Low Performing Schools
As we saw in the school summary, we see here. There is not a big difference between the including and excluding the 9th graders, and it doesn't change THS's position when looking at overall passing rate.
### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
When we look at the grades for math and reading by grade, we see that the THS 9th graders are on the higher side on average grades, but comparing them to the other grades at THS, and to the other 9th graders, there is not a significant difference. 
### Scores by School Spending
This was a surprising statistic in that it shows that schools that spend more per student have a lower passing rate than those who spend less per capita.

### Scores by School Size
Based on the size of the school we see that larger schools tend to do worse compared to the small and medium schools.

### Scores by School Type
This shows us that charter schools tend to have a much higher passing rate overall compared to district schools.

## Summary
When looking at the analysis as a whole, we can see that there is not much that can show that there was cheating going on with the 9th grade students at THS. This we saw through analyzing math and reading scores both including and excluding the 9th grade students. We also compares the scores overall against other schools that were nearby.
